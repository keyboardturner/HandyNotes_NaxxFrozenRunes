# HandyNotes_NaxxFrozenRunes
<p>This addon is intended for people hunting down the old Naxxramas appearances. It will display the locations of all possible frozen runes on the map. This addon requires <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes">HandyNotes</a>.&nbsp;While player coordinates don't work in dungeons, you can still see map POIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frozen Runes are used in crafting <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/how-to-craft-tier-3-gear-and-obtain-ancient-naxxramas-patterns-333993">Old Naxxramas gear</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This will not work in WoW Classic as there are no maps in instances. Don't.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way of knowing if you've looted a frozen rune already and many of these are in fact actually capable of respawning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find additional Frozen Rune locations, send a screenshot of the map location. I'm pretty sure I got them all but it's always possible I missed one.</p>
